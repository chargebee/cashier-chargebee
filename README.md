## Installation

First, install the Cashier package for Chargebee using the Composer package manager:

```shell
composer require laravel/cashier-chargebee
```

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

<a name="billable-model"></a>
### Billable Model

Before using Cashier, add the `Billable` trait to your billable model definition. Typically, this will be the `App\Models\User` model. This trait provides various methods to allow you to perform common billing tasks, such as creating subscriptions, applying coupons, and updating payment method information:
```php
use Laravel\CashierChargebee\Billable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Billable;
}
```
After installing the package, publish Cashier's migrations using the `vendor:publish` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="cashier-migrations"
```

Then, migrate your database:

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

Cashier's migrations will add several columns to your `users` table. They will also create a new `subscriptions` table to hold all of your customer's subscriptions and a `subscription_items` table for subscriptions with multiple prices.
