## Introduction

Laravel Cashier Chargebee provides an expressive, fluent interface to
[Chargebee's](https://chargebee.com) subscription billing services. It handles
almost all of the boilerplate subscription billing code you are dreading
writing. In addition to basic subscription management, Cashier can handle
swapping subscription, subscription "quantities", subscription pausing,
rendering invoice and much more.
